# KSA-Timetable
A django-based heroku website for automatically creating timetables for KSA students.
# How to use
Go to the link and download the excel file. The file will contain two worksheets, 시간표 and 데이터. Try not to touch 시간표. Instead, modify things from 데이터 worksheet. Everything changed inside that worksheet will be applied to the timetable.
# Advanced
If you want to work with this code, all the interesting stuff are in time_table/excel.py file. The rest is just regular django stuff.
